# Impostor: League of Legends Edition

A real-time, web-based social deduction game set in the world of League of Legends. Find the Impostor who doesn't know the secret champion!

## üéÆ How to Play

The game is simple. Champions must work together to identify the Impostor, while the Impostor must bluff their way to victory.

### 1. The Lobby
- **Create or Join:** One player creates a game and shares the unique **Game ID** with friends. Others join using that ID.
- **Gather Your Team:** A minimum of 3 players is required to start the match.
- **Launch the Game:** The host (the player who created the game) starts the game once everyone is ready.

### 2. The Round
- **ü§´ Secret Roles:** At the start of each round, one player is secretly assigned the role of **Impostor**. All other players become **Champions** and are shown the name of a secret League of Legends champion.
- **üó£Ô∏è Discussion & Deception:** Players discuss amongst themselves. Champions should ask questions about the secret champion to test each other's knowledge. The Impostor, who doesn't know the champion, must lie, deflect, and act like they know to avoid suspicion.
- **üó≥Ô∏è Voting:** After the discussion, everyone votes for who they think the Impostor is. You cannot vote for yourself.

### 3. The Verdict
- **Elimination:** The player with the most votes is eliminated, and their true role is revealed to everyone.
- **Tie:** If the vote is a tie, no one is eliminated, and the discussion continues in the next round.

### üèÜ Winning the Game
- **‚ú® Champions Win** if they successfully vote out the Impostor.
- **üî™ Impostor Wins** if they survive until only two players (themselves and one Champion) remain.
